Answer the following, add your answer below each question:
Q1) Copy and paste the ID of the commit that caused the bug (fast shooting)?
commit id: 25ed

Q2) Copy and paste the line(s) of code you expect to have caused the bug? 
    -  this.delayBeforeBullet = 10;
    
    -  Text.renderText(ipad ? 'Touch Screen to Start' : 'Press Space to Start', 36, Game.canvasWidth/2 - 270, Game.canvasHeight/2);       
    +  Text.renderText(window.ipad ? 'Touch Screen to Start' : 'Press Space to Start', 36, Game.canvasWidth/2 - 270, Game.canvasHeight/2);

    These are the changes between the last file that was working correctly and the file with bug. I expect from the code that the main 
    reason of the bug was because of deleting the following line -> this.delayBeforeBullet = 10;

Q3) Fix the bug and commit your changes of this fix on the master branch? Paste the commit ID below.
    commit id: db816b18f4a41803b36845a13c43a5a98e253e0a

Q4) Copy and paste the name of the developer who has been recently working on the coins branch.
